# Video Editing Orchestrator (Router)

Detect the video format, route to the correct editing skill, and provide shared knowledge (component library, brand assets, rules). This skill does NOT contain the editing process — the sub-skills do.

---

## Phase 0: Detect Format & Route

### Step 1: Determine Video Duration

| Duration | Format | Route To |
|----------|--------|----------|
| **< 90 seconds** | Short-form | Read `.claude/skills/short-form-editing/SKILL.md` |
| **90s – 5 min** | Medium | Read `.claude/skills/short-form-editing/SKILL.md` (use higher pop-out density) |
| **5+ minutes** | Long-form | Read `.claude/skills/long-form-editing/SKILL.md` |

### Step 2: Style Selection

1. Check if user specified a style (e.g., "edit in stippled editorial style", "use high-contrast style")
2. If not specified, read `remotion/playbook/styles/_index.md` and ask user to pick
3. If user says "default" or nothing specific, use existing INFINITX orange (`remotion/lib/colors.ts`)
4. Load selected style file from `remotion/playbook/styles/{slug}.md`
5. Pass style context to sub-skill: style ID, color palette, component preferences, animation energy

### Step 3: Load the Sub-Skill

Read the FULL SKILL.md for the detected format. Follow its phased process exactly.

**RULE:** Do NOT edit a video without first loading the correct sub-skill. The sub-skill contains the full process, duration tiers, component choices, and density rules.

### Step 4: Load Shared Knowledge

Both sub-skills reference the shared knowledge below. Read this section for component library, brand assets, and rules.

**Also load these catalogs** (used during scene planning and pop-out selection):
- `remotion/playbook/animations/_index.md` — animation catalog with semantic cards
- `remotion/playbook/components/_index.md` — component decision tree + semantic cards
- `remotion/playbook/scene-planning.md` — structured scene plan methodology

## Shared Knowledge

### Visual Restraint Philosophy (The #1 Editing Rule)

**The biggest mistake is too many pop-outs.** A video with 6 well-chosen illustrations beats one with 12 mediocre ones. The speaker's face and voice are the primary content — pop-outs are punctuation, not the paragraph.

#### Impact Score — Score EVERY potential pop-out before adding:

| Impact | When to Use | Visual Treatment |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|
| **A (Must-have)** | Core thesis, hero stat/number, brand reveal, transformation moment, CTA | ALWAYS gets a pop-out |
| **B (Nice-to-have)** | Supporting evidence, named tools, secondary stats, emotional beats | Pop-out ONLY if 7+ seconds from nearest A-tier |
| **C (Skip)** | Filler, repeated ideas, transitions, adjectives, obvious statements | NO pop-out — captions + speaker carry it |

**Process:** List all potential edit points → Score each A/B/C → Add all A-tier → Add B-tier only where spacing allows → Never add C-tier. If total exceeds format max, cut weakest B-tier first.

#### Visual Treatment Hierarchy — Not every pop-out needs a full illustration:

| Visual Weight | Component | When to Use | Example |
|--------------|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **Heavy** (full illustration) | `ConceptOverlay` / `AppleStylePopup` with custom SVG | A-tier hero moments only: core thesis, transformation, main CTA | Pipeline diagram, architecture visual, hero stat |
| **Medium** (crystal box) | `FloatingKeyword` with `customVisual` + frosted glass box | A-tier brand reveals, tool mentions with logo | Claude Code logo in glass box, platform icon |
| **Light** (branded keyword) | `FloatingKeyword` text-only, brand orange `#FF7614` | B-tier supporting moments: named concepts, emotional beats | "INFINITX", "Agent Teams", "SUBSCRIBE" |

**Target mix:** A video should be **60-70% light/medium** and only **30-40% heavy** illustrations.

**Gold standard:** Claude Creatives hook (first 55 seconds) — 4 crystal box visuals + 3 branded keywords + 0 heavy full illustrations. Clean, natural, not overwhelming.

#### Spacing Rules:

- **Minimum 7 seconds (210 frames)** between pop-out centers. Non-negotiable.
- **Platform name rapid-fire** is the ONE exception — individual logo pops (30f each) count as a single visual event.
- **Breathing Room Test:** After placing all pop-outs, verify the viewer gets at least 7 seconds of just the speaker (with captions) between each pop-out. If not, remove the least impactful one.
- **When in doubt, CUT the pop-out.** An empty stretch where the speaker is compelling is better than a mediocre illustration that interrupts flow.

#### Crystal Box Style Specs (Medium weight):
```
backgroundColor: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.14-0.18)
backdropFilter: blur(16-24px)
border: 2-3px solid rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.2-0.35)
borderRadius: 28-32px
boxShadow: 0 20px 70px rgba(0,0,0,0.5-0.6), inset 0 1px 0 rgba(255,255,255,0.15-0.2)
```

### Pop-Out Component Library (Current Production)

#### Pop-Out Components

| Component | Use Case | Key Props |
|-----------|----------|-----------|
| `ConceptOverlay` | **Long-form primary (tutorial style)** — solid-white/frosted/dark-blur bg, multiple entrances | `durationInFrames`, `illustration`, `caption?`, `subtitle?`, `illustrationSize`, `accentColor`, `entrance`, `backgroundStyle` |
| `FloatingKeyword` | **Long-form primary (talking-head style)** — bold text + visuals floating on video, speaker always visible. Matt Gray / Founder OS aesthetic. | `durationInFrames`, `text`, `side`, `icon?`, `visual?`, `customVisual?`, `color?`, `fontSize?`, `topPercent?`, `subtext?`, `visualOnly?` |
| `AppleStylePopup` | **Short-form primary** — premium white bg, spring animation | `durationInFrames`, `illustration`, `caption?`, `subtitle?`, `illustrationSize`, `accentColor` |
| `FloatingCard` | Tier 2 supporting details — speaker remains visible | `durationInFrames`, `icon?`, `caption`, `subtitle?`, `position?`, `accentColor?` |
| `PlatformCascade` | Progressive logo grid reveal (platforms accumulate) | Platform logo array |
| `AnnotationBadge` | Metadata pills — small labels ONLY, never for key moments | Label text |
| `KineticText` | Per-character spring animation — hype words ONLY, not concepts | Text content |

#### Long-Form Style Selection Guide

| Video Type | Primary Component | When to Use |
|------------|------------------|-------------|
| Tutorial / walkthrough (screen share heavy) | `ConceptOverlay` | Speaker explains concepts, then shows screen. Pop-outs appear during explanation. |
| Talking-head / story-driven (face on camera) | `FloatingKeyword` | Speaker talks to camera most of the time. Keywords float beside speaker. No full-screen overlays — speaker always visible. |

**FloatingKeyword Style Details:**
- Bold text floats directly on video — NO background panels
- Placed left/right of speaker at 5% from edges
- Supports: `customVisual` (React components), `visual` (images), `icon` (small logos), `visualOnly` (no text)
- Custom illustration components live in a separate `*Illustrations.tsx` file per composition
- Pair with `MissionTracker` (video game HUD) for tutorial phases
- Reference: `ClaudeCreatives.tsx` + `ClaudeCreativesIllustrations.tsx`

**RULE:** Legacy components (BigIllustrationReveal, OrangeIllustrationReveal, CleanIllustrationReveal, IllustrationReveal, ConceptIconReveal, StackedIconsReveal, SmoothCardReveal, BRollIllustration, WhitePopupReveal) are **deprecated**. Do NOT use in new compositions.

#### Caption Components

| Component | Use Case |
|-----------|----------|
| `FullWidthCaption` | Long-form word-by-word captions |
| `PhraseCaption` | Short-form auto-chunking 3-5 word phrases |

#### Structure & Effects Components

| Component | Use Case |
|-----------|----------|
| `FloatingSourceFrame` | PIP overlay showing real source video (top-right) |
| `DynamicZoomWrapper` | Keyframe-based zoom (short-form only — long-form = flat 1.0) |
| `CornerSectionBadge` | Top-left section markers |
| `TransitionFlash` | White flash transitions (8 frames) |

### Brand Asset Library (`public/logos/`)

| Asset | File |
|-------|------|
| Claude Code | `claude-code-terminal.webp` (dark terminal, ASCII block font) |
| Claude AI | `claude-ai-icon.svg` (starburst), `claude-ai-wordmark.png` |
| INFINITX | `infinitx-logo.png` (root public/) |
| GitHub | `github-mark.svg` |
| 13 Platform SVGs | `x.svg`, `instagram.svg`, `linkedin.svg`, `tiktok.svg`, `bluesky.svg`, `facebook.svg`, `youtube.svg`, `pinterest.svg`, `threads.svg`, `googlebusiness.svg`, `telegram.svg`, `snapchat.svg`, `reddit.svg` |

**RULE:** ALWAYS use real images (`Img` + `staticFile()`) for brand logos. NEVER recreate logos as SVG.

---

### Volume Hierarchy

| Layer | Volume | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Speaker voiceover | 1.0 | Untouched (OffthreadVideo) |
| SFX pop | 0.20-0.25 | Pop-out entrances |
| SFX whoosh | 0.14-0.20 | Transitions, hero moments |
| Background music | 0.02 | Barely audible lofi (long-form: first 35s only) |
| Content videos (burned-in captions) | 0.0 | `volume={0}` — separate narration or burned-in audio |
| Content videos (podcast/interview) | 1.0 | `volume={1}` — **speaker's voice IS the content** |

---

### The 10 Hard-Won Rules (Never Break These)

1. **staticFile() = ROOT public/ only.** Never put assets in `remotion/public/`. Copy to root `public/` and restart studio.
2. **Restart studio after adding static files.** Remotion caches at startup. New files 404 until restart.
3. **Kill all node processes before port changes.** `taskkill //F //IM node.exe` on Windows.
4. **Always use `<Img>` from remotion, never HTML `<img>`.** Remotion's Img ensures load-before-render.
5. **`premountFor={fps}` on every Sequence.** Prevents flash-of-empty-content.
6. **Pop-out elements must fade out before next pop-out starts.** Use `durationInFrames` + `interpolate` for fade-out.
7. **SFX density per format.** Short-form: 5-20. Long-form: 35-40 with variety per type. Never per-word.
8. **Full-screen overlays need opaque backgrounds.** Transparent overlays won't cover captions beneath.
9. **Intro overlay vs separate scene — always clarify.** "On top of me speaking" = overlay. "White screen first" = separate scene.
10. **Every video needs an outro CTA.** Logo + CTA text in final 2-3 seconds.
11. **Pipeline clips: video `volume={1}`.** For pipeline clips (extracted from long-form), the speaker's voice is baked into the video file. Use `volume={1}` on OffthreadVideo, not `volume={0}`.
12. **Word data MUST be transcribed from the actual video.** Transcribe from the video being rendered, not derived from a parent/master transcript. Extraction padding causes timestamp drift.
13. **Caption positioning must be verified visually.** Take a screenshot of the video to determine layout type (talking-head vs split-screen) before setting the caption bottom position.
14. **Score before you add.** Every pop-out must pass the Impact Score (A/B/C). C-tier = no pop-out. Period. And not every pop-out needs a full illustration — use FloatingKeyword for lighter moments.

### V2 Illustration Pattern (Motion)

**Location:** `remotion/lib/illustrations/`

Add motion using `useCurrentFrame()` + `interpolate()`:

**Motion Types:**
- Count-up animations (numbers animate to target)
- Stroke draw (`strokeDashoffset` animation)
- Staggered reveals (elements appear with delays)
- Pulse animations (heartbeat via `frame % period`)
- Spring entrances (`spring()` from remotion)

**Design for White Backgrounds:**
- Dark strokes (#1A1A1A, #333333) for contrast
- Colored fills from `COLORS` palette (`remotion/lib/colors.ts`)
- Drop shadows for depth. No white-on-white elements.

```tsx
export const ConceptNameV2: React.FC<{ size?: number }> = ({ size = 600 }) => {
  const frame = useCurrentFrame();
  const scale = spring({ frame, fps: 30, from: 0, to: 1,
    config: { damping: 14, stiffness: 100 } });
  const animatedValue = interpolate(frame, [0, 60], [0, 100],
    { extrapolateRight: "clamp" });
  return (
    <svg viewBox="0 0 600 600" width={size} height={size}>
      {/* Dark strokes, colored fills, designed for white bg */}
    </svg>
  );
};
```

## Evolution Check (End of Every Invocation)

1. Did the format detection fail or feel wrong? → Improve routing logic
2. Is a new video format emerging (medium-form, series)? → Create new sub-skill
3. Did the sub-skill miss something shared? → Add to this router's shared knowledge
4. Was a deprecated component used? → Flag and update
